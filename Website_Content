A THERAPY USING THE POWER OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND
THE KINESTHETIC INTELLIGENCE OF THE BODY

Change your Beliefs and your life WILL CHANGE.
>>(body)
Beliefs, usually subconscious, are the cumulative effect of life-long programming. As a result of our early living environment, our parents beliefs passed onto us, and our own history, we learn to think and behave in self-defeating ways. Subconscious beliefs run every aspect of our daily life with both positive and negative consequences. They affect moods, relationships, job performance, prosperity, self-esteem and even physical health.
​
By changing your subconscious beliefs you can literally create a new reality. You can relase and positively transform past trauma, anxiety, depression, stuck emotions, hypersensitivities, allergies, and even chronic disease with an easy, quick and extremely effective technique.
​
Consider this: The processing capacity of your conscious mind is 2,000 bits of information per second, compared to your subconscious mind, which processes at 4 billion bits per second. If you consciously desire a goal that is not inline with a belief that your subconscious mind is operating with, your conscious mind will never win. You are pitting a 2,000-bit processor against a 4 billion-bit processor. The odds are clearly stacked against your conscious mind achieving its goal without the cooperation of the subconscious.
​
Belief Change Psychology, or PSYCH-K®, is a healing process that combines mental and physical techniques to positively alter the sabotaging beliefs hidden in your subconscious, which shape your attitudes, habits, and ultimately your entire life. It is a direct and targeted path toward healing that can quickly be achieved. Best of all, the effects of this system of therapy can be felt instantly, instead of taking months or years as required by many other techniques.
​
Positive changes in perspective and a decrease in stress levels can be experienced immediately, resulting in palpable feelings of relief and calm. Many clients find that ceasing of self-destructive behavior or habits is no longer a struggle, because the root cause of the behavior is adjusted. Enduring feelings of relief, peace, and empowerment during and after each session are consistently reported.
​
You hold the keys to unlocking your own happiness and achieving your true potential. When you are experiencing a less-than-optimal way of life, you are often too close or too accustomed to the problems to see them clearly, and need support and guidance to find your way to a life full of joy and abundance.  This technique is a direct path to the increased joy that you seek, and I am here to help guide you.

WHAT IS PSYCH-K AND WHY IT WORKS

Experience the Immediate Healing Power of PSYCH-K For Yourself


Belief Change Psychology, utilizes techniques developed by Robert M. Williams M.A. (PSYCH-K®) and highly recommended by Bruce H. Lipton Ph.D., author of The Biology of Belief.

Limiting or destructive beliefs in your subconscious are pinpointed using muscle testing ("What is Muscle Testing?"), a technique that measures your stress response to a thought or concept.
​>>********WHAT IS MUSCLE TESTING LINKS TO ANCHOR WITH SAME NAME IN FAQ SECTION*******
PSYCH-K® identifies your subconscious beliefs by connecting to your Inner Knowing, gauging your bodies minute muscle movements in response to what your subconscious believes. This internal mechanism, similar to a polygraph, provides a built-in communication link. This is a process of personal awakening and discovery. We are able to reveal sabotaging beliefs and replace them with empowering ones that guide you in creating a satisfying life, that reflects the very best you. By changing these subconscious beliefs, you can literally create a new reality for yourself.
​
This technique works with your brain as a whole - communicating with both right and left hemispheres of the brain, the conscious, subconscious, and superconscious minds. It creates a receptive, “Whole-Brain State” that dramatically reduces resistance to change in the subconscious mind. In doing so, we release old, harmful beliefs, and install new, positive thought patterns. These new patterns replace old behaviors and create new effortless ones that move us toward the life we want.

While working with this technique, you are verbally guided through a mental and physical process similar to meditation, which allows expansion of the corpus callosum - the nerve superhighway that connects the two hemispheres of your brain. This provides better communication between the right hemisphere, which deals with visual activities and grouping information, and the left hemisphere, which analyzes and makes decisions about the information collected by the right side.
​
At the core of all behaviors, there are motivating subconscious beliefs. Using this technique, we can quickly reveal what that belief is (something that is difficult or cannot be done in traditional modalities). We then release the negative belief by re-programming a new, supportive belief in its place. 
Results are seen immediately.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

>>small heading(?)
Why does PSYCH-K® work better than traditional therapy?
>>body
Traditional modalities, work with the conscious mind, and can take years to integrate change. Unless changes are made at the subconscious level of the mind, undesired reactions and behaviours will likely continue. Conscious thoughts can be changed easily by receiving new information: reading self-help books, talk therapy or seeing the results of your actions. If conscious information was enough, experiencing success in all areas of life would be simple.

Subconsious thoughts are deeply rooted, and negative ones can be insidious.  The subconscious is like your operating system, and is responsible for all your actions when you are on "autopilot". Changes there result in effortless changes in behaviour.  Clients can experience improvement immediately after a session, and experience dramatic and positive life change in 6-8 sessions. The subconscious mind is where the access to rapid and long lasting change resides.

What is muscle testing?
​>>body
Your body’s electrical activity can reveal a great deal about your health and well-being. Electrical energy travels through your nervous system, which controls your skeletal muscles. Energy that is not able to flow freely through your nervous system (blocked energy) is weakened, and results in a weakened muscle response.

To muscle test, you are asked to think about a triggering situation, or make a statement that, if true, would support your emotional health and well-being. (Example: "I am safe, even when I am afraid.")

Pressure is applied to a predetermined muscle, which  will test either strong or weak, depending on whether your body’s electrical energy is able to flow unobstructed through your nervous system.

Used in this capacity, your emotional response to stimuli guides your path of targeted healing. (If your muscle is weakened, indicating a negative response to a supportive statement, the next step is to correct this negative belief in your subconscious, by replacing it with its countering positive belief statement.

How does PSYCH-K® differ from hypnosis?
​>>body
1.  Clients who have worked with both modalities, report that PSYCH-K® is more effective, and has faster results.

2.  Hypnosis is “done to you” and the majority of the power lies with the practitioner. PSYCH-K® is “done with you”, and is a permission based and collaborative process that engages your inner wisdom. This technique utilizes the powerful resources of the subconscious mind. This approach honors your personal power and responsibility in making important life changes.
​
3.  If you are seeking improvement in an area that you are not comfortable discussing, this technique can be used in a manner that circumvents the need to speak about the issue, preventing even me, your  practicioner from knowing what issue I am working with, yet still achieves the needed growth and healing.

How are sessions done over the phone?
​>>body
I began my work with PSYCH-K® in 2007, and I am trained to be a surrogate for you. We connect through the quantum energy field while we are in session, and I use one of my muscles on your behalf for muscle testing. My clients are able to drop into a deeper state of inner wisdom and comfort while in their own environment, and the time and cost of travel is eliminated, as well as the unfamiliarity of being in another person’s space.

Works Like Magic - Anxiety is Gone!

>>body
"This works like magic! I am amazing! Everyone is responding super positively to me. My new love interest is moving back from Chicago. We had a great night on Sunday.. like the best ever. I really feel fantastic! My dysfunctional ex texted me that he wanted me back and wanted to make us whole, blah blah blah. Normally I'd have a breakdown, but I did not have one anxious reaction. I told him he needs to work on himself, that I want him to be happy and stop hurting himself and others, and that I am completely done with us. I didn't even blink an eye! That is NOT my normal reaction!"

Breaking Free From Anxiety, Depression, and Panic

Breaking Free From Anxiety, Depression, and Panic

>>body
"For most of my life I've struggled with anxiety and depression. I see a therapist and take medication to manage my mood and I've found A Guided Path to be an excellent way to deepen and further the work I've been doing in therapy.

I felt a difference after our very first session and I've continued to see Fae over the past six months. Each session leaves me feeling lighter and more relaxed, as we work through the blocks that are holding me back from the full life I want to live.

A few weeks ago, I had a full on panic attack and I called her. She immediately began walking me through a session. I thought, "Ok, I'll do this but as soon as I hang up the phone I'll drop right back into the attack." but after only 15 or 20 minutes, I was completely calmed down and I couldn't believe it. I was able to go to sleep without taking a sleep aid and those feelings of panic and dread never returned.

Fae is very talented and intuitive - she takes the time to get to know you and your goals. She asks the right questions to intellectualize what the issues are that you'd like to address, and then guides you to look inward to examine and unravel the issues on a deeper level."

Lighter and More Energized! Quick and Easy, with Lasting Effects

>>body
"Fae brings a great combination of pragmatism, empathy and openness to her therapeutic approach.

At first, I was a little skeptical that A Guided Path could work so quickly and easily and have lasting effects, even though I had previously done some work on re-programming my old, self-defeating beliefs on my own. But my first session with Fae proved otherwise!

Fae got at the root of some of my deep-seated issues, found creative ways to address them, and left me feeling much lighter and more energized. That energy and lightness has lasted and helped to accelerate and support the other work that I am doing in my life. Working with Fae is transformative! And fun!"

Power vs. Fear

>>body
My client was working with issues around fear. She felt vulnerable constantly and was having bad anxiety. As she was sitting with her eyes closed toward the end of one of her balances she spoke.
"I see a wolf."
"What is the wolf doing?" I asked.
"Nothing...  just staring at me. It has red eyes like laser beams."
"Is it doing anything?" I inquired as to the wolf's significance.
"No. Just standing there staring. It's like, right there." She held her hand close.
We both came to the same likely conclusion - the wolf most likely signified fear and she would need to confront it. I tested her energy to see if the wolf was fear.
The answer was no.
I pondered.
"Are you the wolf?"
Yes.
I was overcome with happiness for her. She had done it. She had worked through an extremely traumatic issue and it was resolved. Her life was going to be so much easier now.
"The wolf is you." I told her. "That is how powerful you are."

No one messes with a wolf, with laser beams for eyes.

Tension and Release

>>body
Noelle was suffering from prolonged heartbreak and an inability to let go of a painfully dysfunctional on/off relationship that had stretched her like a rubber band for years. She had a pattern of being typecast by her partners into a vixen role - to be used temporarily, but never seriously. As we worked together on how this dynamic came to be, unravel, and heal it, she softened in her chair.
​
"I just felt my hips relax!" She exclaimed. "Everything just let go... It's like I was this big ball of tension and now I'm not.  I didn't even realize I was like that!"
​
The cells in our body remember trauma alongside our brains. Science have proven that aspirin helps with emotional heartache. To our bodies, pain is pain, and it is registered in the same areas of the brain, whether its cause is physical or emotional. It is because of this biology, that emotional pain can have the same stressful results as physical pain. The muscles of the body contract when we are experiencing stress, so that we are ready for a fight, or flight. If the stressor does not relent, the constriction within the body can become chronic, and lead to structural and other health imbalances. Replacing negative beliefs can have a huge positive impact, on mind, body and spirit.

Personal Power - Two Creeps, One Stone.

>>body
My client had been having strange experiences. She spoke in a hushed tone.
"It's crazy. Or I am?! I swear my brothers apartment is haunted."
"What's going on?" I asked.
"Things move." She held up her arm, covered in goosebumps. "I feel really icky in certain rooms. Like someone wants me out..." She went on to detail the things that were occurring in the apartment: how she felt unwelcome, and like someone was watching her. She worried that less sensitive people would think she was crazy for feeling things they couldn't.
We spent her session working around having strong boundaries, and owning her personal power - including the sense that made her keenly aware that something strange was going on.
"You have a knowing that most people don't, but it isn't a curse, it is a gift. And once you know that, you will start using it as such." I told her.
Everything in life is about perspective.
 
Later that week her brother's friend which she referred to as "a creeper" came over. She told me that normally he would stress her out, by droning on and hovering around her endlessly, despite her disinterest. Recalling our session, she envisioned a strong boundary of light surrounding herself... at which point he quickly shifted in his behaviour, and retired to the other room to read a book.
​
Upsetting patterns in our lives are highly indicative of subconscious beliefs that are no longer serving our highest good. Fixing them can reach into and heal multiple areas of our lives, even ones that we had been previously inattentive or numb to.

LET'S WORK TOGETHER

What to Expect

>>body
Some preparation can be beneficial before your appointment, in order to make the most efficient use of our time together. I advise making note of any areas you would like to focus on, including negative patterns or behaviours you would like to work with (yours, or others). Multiple areas and limiting beliefs can be addressed in each session.
​
Relax in a place where you can speak privately. A headset for your phone is ideal.  If you do not have a headset, setting your phone to speaker will suffice. Turn off any distracting electronics. If you have children or pets, make arrangements for their care while you are in session. Have a glass of water handy, dress comfortably, and have a place to sit or lie down. Call me at our designated time. 
​
Our phone sessions typically begin with a period of talk therapy. You may describe challenging or blocked areas that you wish to work with, past traumas that are causing a ripple effect in your present life, and any other pertinent information which helps lead to the source of the limiting beliefs hidden in your subconscious mind.
​
During this time, I take notes, using intuition, muscle and energy testing to guide the focus of the conversation toward the root of the problem areas. Often times, the source lies much deeper than the original area of concern, and affects your life to a much greater degree than you had originally perceived. This is of great benefit, because the areas of your life that see immediate improvement can be vast.
​
Once negative or disempowering beliefs at the core of the problem have been uncovered, empowering statements, similar to positive affirmations are created, to shift the way your mind handles information and stimuli in the area of focus. Each  statement is tailored specifically to fit you, with the goal of supporting your over-all well-being.

Integrative processes are used to replace existing negative beliefs with new positive ones. This can take as little as a few seconds, or as much as a few minutes per statement. These processes have been described as being similar to combinations of meditation, imagination & focus exercises, and coordination movement.
​
Clients typically experience feelings of relief, calm, peace, and increased joy during sessions. These changes take place in minutes and are long-lasting. Occasionally, when dealing with particularly raw or traumatic past events, emotions including grief and sadness may come and go, as the brain comes to terms and releases the experience. These emotions are quickly replaced with feelings of lightness and calm when the new empowering statements are in place.
